    "The terminology used in this labs is as follows: (1) a filter refers to the entire tensor that convolves with an input across all channels (i.e., a multi-channel filter like a 3x3x64 tensor), (2) a single channel filter refers to one channel of the aforementioned filter (e.g., a 3x3x1 convolution kernel), (3) and activation refers to the input or output of the filter depending on context (i.e., input activations for a filter are the inputs from a previous layer, output activations are all the filter outputs from a convolutional layer), (4) an input can refer to all input channels or a single input channel depending on the context (entire filter or single channel filter, respectively). A diagram is provided for clarity and this was covered in detail in the class lecture."
